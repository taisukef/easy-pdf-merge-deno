## easy-pdf-merge-deno

easy-pdf-merge is a module to merge multiple PDFs into a single PDF easily for Deno. This module uses [Apache PDFBox Library 2.0.24](http://pdfbox.apache.org). No special softwares are required for the module to run. But Java 6 or higher must be present.

forked [karuppiah7890/easy-pdf-merge: An npm module to merge PDFs](https://github.com/karuppiah7890/easy-pdf-merge)
## Usage :

```js
import { mergePDF } from "https://taisukef.github.io/easy-pdf-merge-deno/mergePDF.js";

await mergePDF(source_files, dest_file_path);
console.log('Success')
```

source_files must be an array of file paths, with two or more file paths, or the module throws an error accordingly.
dest_file path is the destination path for the merged PDF to be saved.

## Example

### Using relative file paths

```javascript
await mergePDF(['File One.pdf', 'File Two.pdf'], 'File Ouput.pdf');
console.log('Successfully merged!')
```
### Options

You can pass some options to the `merge` function, like this

```javascript
const opts = {
    maxBuffer: 1024 * 500, // 500kb
    maxHeap: '2g' // for setting JVM heap limits to 2GB
};

await mergePDF(['File One.pdf', 'File Two.pdf'], 'File Ouput.pdf', opts);
console.log('Successfully merged!')
```

The default options is this

```javascript
const defaultOpts = {
    maxBuffer: 1024 * 500, // 500kb
    maxHeap: '' // for setting JVM heap limits
};
```

`maxBuffer` - option passed to childprocess invoked by library to run pdfbox.jar java
software. Refer [here](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_maxbuffer_and_unicode)
for docs

`maxHeap` - To pass value to `-Xmx` Java option, for maximum memory allocation.
